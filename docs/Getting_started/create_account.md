# Request Access

In order to use **DIaL3** system at the University of Leicester, you need to  apply for an account.  Access to the **DIaL3 (part of DiRAC)** service is through peer  reviewed applications. There are details of how to request access on the [DiRAC website.](http://www.dirac.ac.uk)

Once access has been approved, accounts are requested through the SAFE project and user management system operated by [EPCC](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/). SAFE stands for **S**ervice **A**dministration **F**rom **E**PCC. Every DiRAC user has an account on SAFE. You can find more information on the [DiRAC website](http://www.dirac.ac.uk).
