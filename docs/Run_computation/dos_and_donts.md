# Dos and Don'ts 

- Please use the login nodes only for compiling and editing jobs. They should not be used for running jobs. Please be noted that jobs running on login nodes might be killed or terminated without prior notice.<br/><br/>
- Always run your computations by submitting it to the queuing system i.e. `SLURM` on **DIaL3**.<br/><br/>
- Interactive jobs should also be run on the compute nodes and the same should not be run on the login nodes.<br/><br/>
- You are advised to use `\scratch` space for your large computations as compared to running them in your `\home` as the `\home` quota is quite limited.<br/><br/>
